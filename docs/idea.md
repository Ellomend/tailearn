#Learning TailwindCSS
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

## Goal of project
We want to learn how to use TailwindCSS to style our Vue 3 project.
### What we want to learn
We want to cover basics like:
- Layout, spacing, sizing, margin, padding, containers, flexbox, grid, responsive design, borders, box alignment, etc
- Typography (font sizes, font weights, etc)
- Colors (text colors, background colors, etc)
- Hover, focus, and other states

### How we will learn
We want to learn by creating few simple pages and components. We will start with a simple landing page and then move on to more complex components like a navbar, cards, etc.

### What we will build
We will build a simple landing page with a navbar, hero section, features section, and a footer. We will also build a few components like cards, buttons, etc.

## Plan
### Planing idea
We want to make a plan for with those ideas in mind:
- We want to cover basics (essentals nothing advanced)
- We want out plan to consist of steps and substeps:
  - Steps are main tasks, substeps are simple tasks.
  - Substeps should not be with estimated time more than 10 minutes.
  - Steps should be as tasks (like issues in GitHub or in Redmine).
    - Steps should have a title, description, and estimated time.
    - Steps preferably should be about exploration and learning (e.g. "Create simple layout with Header, Main, and Footer sections").
